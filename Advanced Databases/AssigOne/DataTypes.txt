**Data for the current state of the application's tables**
Still in the testing state, so things might change later.

**Fact Table: TrainingAttendanceFact**

|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| StudentKey        | INT                                           |

| LocationKey       | INT                                           |
| InstructorKey     | INT                                           |
| AttendanceStatus  | BOOLEAN                                       |
| PerformanceScore  | DECIMAL or FLOAT (depending on precision)     |

Note: the fields StudentKey, ModuleKey, TimeKey, LocationKey, and InstructorKey are surrogate keys used in the context of Dimensional Modeling to establish relationships between the fact table (TrainingAttendanceFact) and the dimension tables (StudentDim, ModuleDim, TimeDim, LocationDim, InstructorDim). They act as foreign keys in the fact table, linking it to the related information in the dimension tables.

*Note*: that the specific data types can vary based on the database system we are using and the requirements of the data. It's essential to choose appropriate data types that match our data's characteristics and our DBMS's capabilities.

Here are the keys in more details: 

1. **StudentKey**: This is a surrogate key for the `StudentDim` dimension table. It is a unique identifier for each student. In the fact table, it is used to associate a specific student's attendance and performance data with the student's details in the dimension table.

2. **ModuleKey**: This is a surrogate key for the `ModuleDim` dimension table. It uniquely identifies each training module. In the fact table, it is used to associate attendance and performance data with a particular training module's details.

3. **TimeKey**: This is a surrogate key for the `TimeDim` dimension table. It represents different time periods, such as dates, months, quarters, or years. In the fact table, it is used to link attendance and performance data to specific time periods.

4. **LocationKey**: This is a surrogate key for the `LocationDim` dimension table. It uniquely identifies different training locations. In the fact table, it is used to connect attendance and performance data to specific training locations.

5. **InstructorKey**: This is a surrogate key for the `InstructorDim` dimension table. It uniquely identifies different instructors. In the fact table, it is used to associate attendance and performance data with instructors.
