 Project Overview

Objective:
The main objective of this software management system is to develop a comprehensive HealthConnect that addresses various aspects of good health, including physical fitness, mental health, nutrition, hospitals, user notes system, and user profiles.

Key Features:
- User Authentication and Profiles
  - Users can log in at any time, with the first security layer ensuring data access belongs to the user.
  - Updating, deleting, and displaying user profiles is supported, with the option to create a new account.

- Appointment Booking System
  - Users can book and search for appointments, allowing multiple appointments with a one-to-many relationship to user profiles.
  - Features include deleting, updating, searching, and displaying appointments.

- Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR)
  - Users can check their EHR, including history and current medications.
  - EHR and user profiles have a one-to-one relationship.
  - Printing EHR to a text file (.txt) is supported, with an official HER issued, stating the date and time.

- Notes and To-Do Lists
  - Users can use the app as a to-do list or for important notes to organize thoughts.
  - Features include displaying, deleting, searching, and adding new notes.
  - Data is saved to an ArrayList, with the option to print to a file (.dat), and additional functionalities to read from the file.

- Database Integration
  - Java will connect through MySQL to establish a database.
  - Data for user profiles, appointments, and EHR will be stored in the MySQL database.
  - A temporary copy of this data will be stored in ArrayLists for credential and security purposes.
  - Another ArrayList will be used for saving userâ€™s notes.
